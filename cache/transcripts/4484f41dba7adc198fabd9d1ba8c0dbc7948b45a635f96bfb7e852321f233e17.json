{"success": true, "transcript": "This is why you cannot quit pornography. Because you don't want to. It sounds very simple, but it really goes deeper than that. The reason why you don't want to is because you're afraid of the unknown. You're afraid that maybe if you leave this addiction behind, you're not going to be able to have anything else to comfort you when you feel discomfort. Maybe God's calling you to somewhere great. Maybe God wants you to do something great for his kingdom. But you're afraid to leave that addiction behind because it's such a part of your identity. You've gotten comfortable with it. You probably don't even like doing it, right? You probably feel guilty when you finish doing it. But you can't figure out why you can't stop. And that's because you're not willing to change your identity. Let me give you a scenario. Let's say there's two smokers, right? Two ex-smokers. One of them says, I'm trying to quit smoking. And the other one says, I don't smoke. Which one do you think is going to stay free? The one who says, I don't smoke. Because the moment you change your identity is the moment you change your actions. And the moment you change your actions is the moment you change your future. For example, let's say one of these smokers or both of these smokers get tempted with the same temptation. Say one of them has a group of friends, right? Their old group of friends. And they say, come smoke with us. And the ex-smoker, the guy that says, I'm trying to quit, says, oh, I'm just trying to quit. I don't want to do that anymore. Do you think the smokers are going to leave him alone? Or do you think they're going to keep tempting him and keep testing him to see if he's going to break? They're going to keep tempting him because he still is holding on to that identity that he still smokes deep down. Just like you saying, I'm trying to quit porn. I'm trying to quit masturbation or whatever it is. You are holding on to the identity that you still do it. And that's why you can't quit. The reason why you keep tracking your streak. Oh, I'm on a 30-day streak. Right? Because you believe that one day you're going to break the streak. And that's why I tell you to stop tracking it, bro. Because if you keep tracking your streak, if you keep tracking the days, you're free from pornography. Instead of counting the days, just make the days count. All right? And let's say the other smoker, the guy that says, I don't smoke, was tempted by the same group of friends. What do you think the friends would say? They're not going to be like, oh, come smoke with us. They're not going to attempt to because he says he doesn't smoke. He's not a smoker. All right? If they do say that, they're just bad friends. But the majority of people won't do that because they respect that people don't do this anymore or people don't do this at all. Right? So the moral of today, the moral of this message is that you must want to quit and you must change your identity. Because I can't help you. God can help you unless you want to help yourself, unless you want to actually change. God wants to help you, I promise you. But you have to make the decision to help yourself first, to receive the help from God, to receive the help from me or even anyone else in your life that's trying to help you with this. All right? So with that said, if you feel like this addiction is keeping you from knowing God and your God-given purpose and allowing you to live a fulfilling, guilt-free life and confident, abundant life, make sure to click the top link in the description. I'll get started with you and we'll break this addiction together. But with that said, I'm going to see you on the next one. Peace.
